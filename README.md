# Mathematics-articles
Here is some of my past research work in mathematics.

The article [Solving Irreducible Stochastic Mean-Payoff Games and Entropy Games by Relative Krasnoselskii–Mann Iteration](/Krasnoselskii-Mann_article) was written in the framework of a research projet during my third year at Ecole Polytechnique, thanks to the brilliant supervision of Professors Marianne Akian and Stéphane Gaubert, and was accepted at __Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science (MFCS) 2023__ and can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02458)

At the end of my 3rd year, I spent 5 months at __Imperial College__ to do research under the supervision of Pr. Antoine Jacquier and Ioannis Gasteratos. You can find my report and slides of oral presentation in [this section](/Rough_paths_Imperial_College).

The file [Mean_field_limit](/Mean_field_Limit.pdf) is my report on a second research project I did during my third year at Ecole Polytechnique.
